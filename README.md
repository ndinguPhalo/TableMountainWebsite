# TableMountainWebsite
Mock table mountain website  advertising the wonders of the ninth wonder of the natural world.  No affiliation with Table Mountain National Park

This project includes these three pages:

## Home
Where you are greeted by a video and are implored to enjoy the ninth wonder of the world

## About
Where you are given facts about the mountain alongside various images of the mountain.

## Contact
Where you are given the contact details of the table mountain cable way so that you people can enjoy table mountain today!

This project relies on its HTML and CSS files mainly as the javascript files are largely empty for now as there was not too much use for them now however there is room for their use later on.

Special thanks
